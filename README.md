wikipy
======

Collection of Python made tools to get the biggest list of well known people from Wikipedia

<h4>Some ideas how to make this:</h4>
1) Using Semantic web machnism and DBpedia, create different searches, check and parse the result. Use <code>rdflib</code>
2) Manually find all wikipedia lists with people, parse them for links and parse the target pages. Use <code>bs4, requests</code>, etc

I'll try to start with 2nd.
